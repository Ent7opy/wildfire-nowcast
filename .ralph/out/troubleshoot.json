  "diagnosis": "Task T16 has exceeded maximum unblock attempts (3 > 2) and the blocking issue is a code-level bug in the test implementation, not a configuration or environment issue.\n\nDiagnosis:\n1. Test file api/tests/test_jit_forecast_integration.py was successfully created and committed (commit 0e1a964)\n2. Python path configuration was fixed via api/tests/conftest.py (T99, commit 74b1abc)\n3. Pytest can successfully collect the integration tests without import errors\n4. However, test_jit_pipeline_invalid_bbox fails with KeyError on 'detail' field at line 258\n5. The test expects response.json()[\"detail\"] but the actual FastAPI response structure differs\n\nRoot cause:\nThe test code assumes FastAPI HTTPException errors return a response with a top-level 'detail' key. The actual response format needs to be investigated and the test assertions updated accordingly. This requires modifying test code to match the actual API response structure - a substantive code change beyond config/git-state fixes.\n\nFiles verified:\n- api/tests/test_jit_forecast_integration.py (committed, no uncommitted changes)\n- api/tests/conftest.py (committed, correctly adds workspace to sys.path)\n- api/routes/forecast.py (raises HTTPException with detail at line 158, but response format differs in test context)\n\nThis is a code correctness issue requiring human review of the FastAPI error response format and corresponding test assertion updates. Cannot be resolved with configuration-only changes.",
