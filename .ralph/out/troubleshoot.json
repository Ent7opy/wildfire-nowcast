These tasks have status='todo' but are missing all required fields: id, title, priority, description, acceptance, verification. Worker cannot select a task without these fields. The worker's code inspection also suggests that the remaining valid tasks (WN-FIRE-006, WN-FIRE-007) may already be implemented, but the immediate blocker is the malformed task objects preventing task selection. Surgical fix: remove the two malformed objects from the tasks array in state.json.",
