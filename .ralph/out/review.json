    "All acceptance criteria satisfied:",
    "1. File api/tests/conftest.py exists (verified as untracked file)",
    "2. conftest.py adds workspace root to sys.path at test collection time (lines 15-17, verified by successful pytest collection)",
    "3. conftest.py registers pytest.mark.integration custom mark (lines 20-25 via pytest_configure, verified with --strict-markers flag)",
    "4. Integration test collection succeeds without AttributeError (5 tests collected successfully)",
    "5. No marker warnings with strict mode",
    "",
    "Implementation quality:",
    "- Uses Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent to correctly compute workspace root",
    "- Checks if path already in sys.path before adding (idempotent)",
    "- Well-documented with clear docstring and inline comments",
    "- Follows pytest conventions for conftest.py and pytest_configure hook",
    "",
    "Note: The test execution of test_jit_pipeline_invalid_bbox failed with KeyError on 'detail' field. This is a bug in the test itself (response.json() doesn't contain expected 'detail' key), NOT an import issue. This is out of scope for T99, which only addresses Python path configuration for cross-module imports. The fact that the test ran and failed on an assertion proves that imports are working correctly."
