      "title": "Unintended behavioral change affects all weather ingestion, not just patch_mode",
      "evidence": "ingest/weather_ingest.py:785 - Changed from `crop_to_bbox(dataset, settings, target_bbox=grid_bounds(grid_spec))` to `crop_to_bbox(dataset, settings, target_bbox=bbox)`. This change affects ALL weather ingestion calls, not just when patch_mode=True. The grid_spec is snapped to 0.01° cell boundaries via GridSpec.from_bbox(), but the crop now uses the exact user-provided bbox instead of the cell-aligned bounds. This creates a mismatch between grid metadata (which describes snapped cells) and actual data extent.",
      "suggested_fix": "Either: (A) Revert this line to use `grid_bounds(grid_spec)` and ensure patch mode works correctly with snapped bounds, OR (B) If the intent is to change cropping behavior for all ingestion, document this breaking change, add a note explaining why, and add test coverage for the new behavior. The task scope (T14) only mentions patch_mode changes, so option A (revert) is recommended to minimize scope."

    {
      "severity": "must",
      "title": "Acceptance criterion wording mismatch with implementation",
      "evidence": "Task acceptance criterion #2 states 'Weather cube output is spatially limited to bbox + margin'. Implementation crops output to original bbox (line 786: `target_bbox=bbox`), NOT bbox + margin. Worker notes say 'cropping output to original bbox' which matches implementation but contradicts acceptance criterion text.",
      "suggested_fix": "Clarify acceptance criterion #2. If the intent is 'output matches original bbox' (not bbox + margin), update the acceptance text. If output should actually include the margin, change line 786 to: `target_bbox=download_bbox` (when patch_mode=True only)."

      "severity": "must",
      "title": "No verification evidence - acceptance criterion #4 not met",
      "evidence": "Task acceptance criterion #4: 'Benchmark shows measurable speedup'. Task verification section lists: 'Would run: cd ingest && uv run python weather_ingest.py --bbox 20,40,20.1,40.1 --patch-mode' and 'Would run: time comparison of patch vs full mode'. Benchmark script exists at scripts/benchmark_weather_patch_mode.py but no evidence it was executed. No timing data or speedup measurement provided.",
      "suggested_fix": "Run the benchmark script or at least one manual timing comparison showing patch_mode is faster than default mode for a small AOI. Document the results in task notes or commit message. Without this, acceptance criterion #4 remains unmet."

      "evidence": "New test file ingest/tests/test_weather_ingest.py exists but is untracked (git status shows 'Untracked files'). Task verification says 'Would run: make test (ingest tests)' but no evidence tests were actually run. Tests use heavy mocking and won't catch integration issues.",
      "suggested_fix": "Run `cd ingest && uv run pytest tests/test_weather_ingest.py -v` and confirm all tests pass. Add the test file to git. Consider adding at least one integration test that validates the patch_mode parameter flow (even if it mocks external HTTP calls)."

    "Implementation correctly adds patch_mode parameter and threads it through CLI to ingest_weather_for_bbox().",

    "Spatial margin logic (0.5° padding) for download_bbox is correctly implemented.",
    "Documentation updates in docs/ingest/ingest_weather.md clearly explain patch mode usage.",
    "Minor: patch_mode silently overrides user-specified horizon_hours/step_hours/include_precipitation parameters. This is acceptable given the docstring explains the optimization, but could be mentioned more explicitly.",
    "Minor: No validation that bbox is actually small (<50km x 50km) for patch mode. User could enable patch_mode for large regions and get suboptimal 24h horizon.",
    "The most critical issue is #1 (unintended behavioral change affecting all ingestion). This should be fixed before approval."
