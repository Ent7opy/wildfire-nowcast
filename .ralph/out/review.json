    "Ran: git status - confirmed modified docs/GETTING_STARTED.md",
    "Ran: git diff - confirmed addition of 'Generating and Viewing Forecast Overlays' section",
    "Would run: Follow documented steps to verify overlay appears (requires fresh environment with Docker, FIRMS API key, and ecCodes)"
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Documentation correctly implements the complete forecast overlay workflow with all required steps in proper order.",
    "Critical fix from previous review cycle has been properly applied: terrain ingestion is now documented as required (Step 2.5) and appears BEFORE forecast generation (Step 3).",
    "Verified against codebase: api/routes/forecast.py line 167 calls get_region_grid_spec(request.region_name), which requires terrain metadata per api/fires/service.py lines 20-38. Documentation now correctly addresses this dependency.",
    "All commands are copy/paste runnable with clear instructions for required placeholder replacements (e.g., <YYYY-MM-DD> with explicit guidance).",
    "Workflow completeness verified: weather ingest → fire data → terrain data (required) → forecast generation → UI viewing.",
    "Each major step includes verification commands (e.g., psql queries to check ingested data).",
    "Parameters are consistent across steps: region_name='balkans' and bbox match between terrain ingestion and forecast generation.",
    "Quick Reference section (lines 337-390) provides consolidated commands for both Docker Compose and manual setup workflows.",
    "Optional terrain section (lines 283-290) correctly clarified as 'For Other Regions' to avoid confusion with the required Balkans example."
